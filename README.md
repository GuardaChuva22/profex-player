# Profex Player

"For freedom üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è"

Profex Player is a stealthy, command-line and hotkey-driven music player that supports YouTube and Spotify link playback. It runs hidden in the system tray and can be controlled globally.

## Features

*   **Stealth Operation**: Runs from the system tray with a generic name ("Windows Defender Terminal" by default) and icon. The main interaction window can be hidden.
*   **YouTube & Spotify Support**: Play individual tracks or playlists from YouTube (direct URL or search) and Spotify (track or playlist URLs, which are then searched on YouTube).
*   **Global Hotkeys**: Control playback (play, pause, skip, volume, etc.) from anywhere in your OS. All hotkeys are configurable.
*   **Command-Line Interface**: Access all features through a simple command interface in the popup window.
*   **Playlist Management**:
    *   View the current queue (`queue` or `list` command, with verbose option).
    *   Shuffle the queue (`shuffle` command and hotkey).
    *   Save and load queues to/from files (`savequeue`, `loadqueue` commands).
    *   Remove songs from the queue by index (`remove` command).
    *   Clear the entire queue (`clear` command).
    *   Toggle loop mode for the queue (`loop` command and hotkey).
*   **Configurable**: Hotkeys, default volume, idle timeout, and Spotify API credentials can be configured via `lib/config/config.json`.
*   **Auto-Shutdown Features**:
    *   Idle timeout (terminates if inactive for a set period).
    *   Terminates if the Windows lock screen (LogonUI.exe) is detected.
*   **Error Handling**: Plays an error sound for many user-facing errors. Detailed logging for troubleshooting.

## Default Hotkeys

These are the default hotkeys. You can customize them in `lib/config/config.json`.

*   **Terminate App:** `ctrl+shift+q`
*   **Pause Playback:** `ctrl+alt+space`
*   **Resume/Play:** `ctrl+alt+r` (Note: `play` is also `ctrl+alt+p` but `resume` is generally more used)
*   **Skip Track:** `ctrl+alt+s`
*   **Stop Playback & Clear Queue:** `ctrl+alt+q`
*   **Volume Up:** `ctrl+alt+up`
*   **Volume Down:** `ctrl+alt+down`
*   **Seek Forward (10s):** `ctrl+alt+right`
*   **Seek Backward (10s):** `ctrl+alt+left`
*   **Toggle Loop Queue:** `ctrl+alt+l`
*   **Shuffle Queue:** `ctrl+alt+h`
*   **(Example) View Queue:** `ctrl+alt+v` (Note: This hotkey is configured by default but currently only logs that it needs a target function for notifications. The `queue` command in the text interface is functional.)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Some default keybinds might conflict with system shortcuts or other applications. Please check `lib/config/config.json` and adjust them if necessary.

## Commands

Interact with the player by typing commands into its window (accessible from the system tray icon).

*   `play <query/url>`: Plays a song/playlist from YouTube/Spotify or searches YouTube.
    *   Example (YouTube URL): `play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
    *   Example (YouTube Search): `play Never Gonna Give You Up`
    *   Example (Spotify Track URL): `play https://open.spotify.com/track/4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT`
    *   Example (Spotify Playlist URL): `play https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`
*   `pause`: Pauses the current playback.
*   `resume`: Resumes the current playback.
*   `skip` / `next`: Skips to the next song in the queue.
*   `stop`: Stops playback and clears the entire queue.
*   `volume <0-100>` / `vol <0-100>`: Sets the volume (e.g., `volume 75`).
*   `loop`: Toggles looping of the current queue.
*   `shuffle`: Shuffles the songs currently in the queue.
*   `clear`: Clears all songs from the queue.
*   `queue [-v|--verbose]` / `list [-v|--verbose]`: Displays the current song queue.
    *   Use `-v` or `--verbose` for more detailed output (e.g., includes URLs).
*   `remove <index>`: Removes a song from the queue by its index (0-based, as shown in the `queue` command).
*   `savequeue <filename>`: Saves the current queue to a file (e.g., `savequeue mymix`). Files are saved in `lib/playlists/`.
    *   The `.txt` extension is added automatically if not provided.
*   `loadqueue [--append|-a] <filename>`: Loads a queue from a file.
    *   Example: `loadqueue mymix` (replaces current queue)
    *   Example: `loadqueue --append mymix` or `loadqueue -a mymix` (adds to current queue)
*   `exit` / `quit`: Exits the application.
*   `help`: Displays a list of available commands.

## Setup & Configuration

1.  **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed. Install required packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install python-vlc Pillow pystray keyboard yt-dlp spotipy
    ```
    You also need VLC media player installed on your system, as `python-vlc` is a binding to it.

2.  **Configuration File (`lib/config/config.json`)**:
    *   On the first run, a default `config.json` will be created in the `lib/config/` directory.
    *   **Spotify API Credentials**: To play Spotify links (which are searched on YouTube), you need to provide your Spotify API `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
        *   Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
        *   Create an app to get your credentials.
        *   Edit `config.json` and replace `"YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE"` and `"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"` with your actual credentials.
    *   **Hotkeys**: You can customize all hotkeys in this file. Refer to the `keyboard` library's format for hotkey strings (e.g., `ctrl+alt+s`).
    *   **Other Settings**: `default_volume`, `idle_timeout` can also be adjusted.

## How It Works

*   **Spotify Links**: When a Spotify link is provided, the application uses the Spotify API to fetch track names and artists. It then searches for these tracks on YouTube using `yt-dlp`.
*   **YouTube Links/Search**: Direct YouTube links are played, and search queries use `yt-dlp` to find and stream the best audio match.
*   **Playback**: VLC is used for media playback via `python-vlc`.
*   **Global Hotkeys**: The `keyboard` library listens for system-wide hotkeys.
*   **System Tray**: `pystray` manages the system tray icon and menu.
